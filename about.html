        <h2>Why Did I Make This Site</h2>
        <p>I often find difficulty finding math formulas online this gets often annoying due to me being a pretty forgetful person. I thought that it would have been a great idea to create this type of website not only for myself but also to help other. In the future this site will hopefully be updated with new features and new material.</p>

        <h2>About Myself</h2>
        <p>I am a 14 year old St. Thomas student, I am in secondary 3, I live in Canada and I am extremely interested in computers/programming. I have always wondered how some of this type of stuff works and now look at me, I'm doing it! In the future I espire to be someone well known in the cyber world hopefully by developing software to help others.</p>
